Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [High Meadows Environmental Institute](https://environment.princeton.edu/people/adam-wiechman/), working in the [Levin Lab](https://slevin.princeton.edu/people/adam-wiechman-phd). In September 2026, I will join the [Wagner School of Public Service](https://wagner.nyu.edu/) at New York University as an Assistant Professor. 

Prior to my current position, I earned my PhD in Sustainability with a concentration in Complex Adaptive Systems Science from the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University in May 2025, advised by John "Marty" Anderies. While at ASU, I was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and received the [Outstanding Graduating Student Award](https://news.asu.edu/20250509-sun-devil-community-asu-grad-takes-interdisciplinary-water-research-princeton-then-nyu) for the College of Global Futures. I have an interdisciplinary background in engineering and politics, having earned dual bachelor's degrees in Environmental Engineering and Political Science from the University of Notre Dame (2020) as well as working in a variety of engineering and policy research roles before graduate school. A central throughline in work is bringing the political and governance realities of infrastructure investment into our scholarly and practical understanding of dynamic infrastructure systems. 

My Work
======

At the core of my work is the following question: 
> How do ***political processes*** affect the ***robustness*** of public infrastructure systems to socio-economic and environmental change?
