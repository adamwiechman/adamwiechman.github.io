Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [High Meadows Environmental Institute](https://environment.princeton.edu/people/adam-wiechman/), working in the [Levin Lab](https://slevin.princeton.edu/people/adam-wiechman-phd), at Princeton University. In September 2026, I will join the [Wagner School of Public Service](https://wagner.nyu.edu/) at New York University as an Assistant Professor. 

I earned my PhD in Sustainability with a concentration in Complex Adaptive Systems Science from the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University in May 2025, advised by Marty Anderies. While at ASU, I was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and received the [Outstanding Graduating Student Award](https://news.asu.edu/20250509-sun-devil-community-asu-grad-takes-interdisciplinary-water-research-princeton-then-nyu) for the College of Global Futures. I have an interdisciplinary background in engineering and politics, having earned dual bachelor's degrees in Environmental Engineering and Political Science from the University of Notre Dame (2020) as well as working in a variety of engineering and policy research roles before graduate school. A key throughline in my work is bringing the political and governance realities of infrastructure investment into our scholarly and practical understanding of infrastructure systems. 

My Work
======

My research advances our understanding of how politics, from elections to administrative implementation, affect the resilience and distribution of benefits in our critical public infrastructure systems. At the center of my work is the following question: 

> How do ***political processes*** affect the ***robustness*** of public infrastructure systems to socio-economic and environmental change? 

To address this question from a holistic perspective, I pull from and contribute to multiple fields, including engineering, political science, public policy and administration, and psychology. My prior work has primarily revolved around drinking water, but I am expanding the scope of my work to other types of infrastructure systems, including flooding, transportation, and electricity.

I often opt for the term, ***robustness***, as a unifying concept due to its precise definition, primarily found in engineering. A system is robust if a desired outcome (e.g., level of water supply, traffic congestion, affordability, etc.) is *insensitive* to a change in inputs (e.g., rainfall, gas prices, immigration, etc.). Robustness is therefore, simply the opposite of sensitivity. The beauty of a robustness framing is that you can address multiple outcomes of interest or uncertainties by specifying, (i) what outcome you care about (the "of what" question) and (ii) to what input you are uncertain (the "to what" question). In the rapidly evolving field of ***sustainability*** I argue that most questions ultimately boil down to *which* outcomes and uncertainties should be prioritized. The answer to such questions is the role of ***politics***.

My work consists of three tracks to tackle the complexity of infrastructure politics from multiple angles. 

1. ***Applied*** *modeling of infrastructure systems that incorporates governance dynamics, co-produced with practitioners.* I incorporate models from cognitive and institutional sciences that provide a more realistic representation of how individuals and organizations responsible for infrastructure investment make decisions and respond to changes into computational dynamic models of infrastructure systems. 
2. ***Empirical*** *investigation of how infrastructure policymakers make decisions and collaborate.* Data collected in this track is primarily surveys, interviews, and documents. 
3. ***Theoretical*** *modeling of shared infrastructure governance that transcends infrastructure type.* I use the formal language provided by dynamical systems modeling to understand the patterns of infrastructure governance, regardless of infrastructure type, that contribute to various robustness outcomes of interest.

Refer to my [Current Projects](/projects/) for more information on work in each of these tracks.
