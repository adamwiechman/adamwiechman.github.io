Below, I outline the projects that I am currently working on, each one being at a different stage of development. I note where the project fits within the research tracks I outline on my [About Me](/about/) page, infrastructure types examined, scope of the case, methods used, questions, relevant publications, and a project overview. Please reach out to me if you would like more information on any of the projects. 

## Uncertainty, Institutional Design, Collaboration, and Infrastructure Investment
- ***Tracks:*** Empirical Investigation (2), Theoretical Modeling (3)
- ***Infrastructure Type(s):*** Flooding and EV Charging
- ***Scope:*** US Local Public Managers 
- ***Method(s):*** surveys, interviews, structural equation modeling, agent-based modeling

> ***Question(s):***
> 1. How does environmental, financial, and user demand uncertainty affect local infrastructure managers, within varying organizational contexts and collaborative networks, in their,
>> a. prioritization of investment strategies <br>
>> b. participation behavior in collaborative forums pertaining to infrastructure investment
> 2. How does the institutional design of local public infrastructure providers and interlocal collaborative forums affect,
>> a. local infrastructure system robustness to environmental, social, and funding change? <br>
>> b. the distributional equity of infrastructure capacity across a region of coupled systems?
